    "subtitle": "Principal-Level Software Engineer ",
    "tagline": "With a proven track record in AI systems, Azure, and DevOps at enterprise scale.",
    "heading": "About",
    "paragraph1": "I'm a seasoned software engineer with over two decades of experience, including nearly nine years at Microsoft. My career has spanned roles from Technical Evangelist in Developer Experience to Cloud Solution Architect with Global Partner Solutions, culminating as a Senior Software Engineer in Azure Core (One Fleet Partner).",
    "paragraph2": "Throughout my tenure at Microsoft, I've developed deep expertise in Azure cloud engineering, DevOps practices, and AI-driven software development. Notably, I've collaborated closely with the Semantic Kernel and Copilot teams at Microsoft to build cutting-edge AI solutions.",
    "paragraph3": "Prior to Microsoft, I spent 13 years at Fred IT Group as Lead Technical Architect, managing a team of six engineers to design scalable platforms for the pharmacy and healthcare industry.",
    "paragraph4": "I'm not worried about AI eliminating software developers - I'm more concerned about developers who aren't using AI being outpaced by those who do. For that reason, I'm intensely focused on mastering and integrating agentic coding tools, empowering cloud engineers to leverage AI proactively and stay ahead.",
    "paragraph5": "Outside of work, I co-parent two teenagers with my partner, endeavour to automate my household, enjoy time with my dog Pip (named after the Python package manager), and perform as a vocalist in a cover band."
