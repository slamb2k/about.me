# ADR-001: Component Architecture Decision

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to establish a consistent architecture for UI components in the Component Forge project. The key decisions were around component structure, styling approach, accessibility implementation, and performance optimization.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a component architecture with the following characteristics:

### 1. Component Structure

**Decision**: Use a compound component pattern with barrel exports

**Rationale**:

- Provides flexibility in usage while maintaining consistency
- Allows for logical grouping of related components (e.g., Card, CardHeader, CardContent)
- Enables tree-shaking for better bundle size
- Improves developer experience with clear component relationships

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// Card/index.tsx
export { Card } from './Card';
export { CardHeader } from './CardHeader';
export { CardTitle } from './CardTitle';
export { CardDescription } from './CardDescription';
export { CardContent } from './CardContent';
export { CardFooter } from './CardFooter';

// ui/index.tsx
export * from './Card';
export * from './Button';
// ...
```

### 2. Styling Approach

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS with class-variance-authority (CVA) for component variants

**Rationale**:

- Provides utility-first approach for rapid development
- CVA offers type-safe variant management
- Enables design system consistency
- Supports responsive design patterns
- Allows for easy customization and theming

**Implementation**:

```typescript
import { cva } from 'class-variance-authority';

const buttonVariants = cva(
  'inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors',
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90',
        destructive: 'bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90',
        // ...
      },
      size: {
        default: 'h-10 px-4 py-2',
        sm: 'h-9 rounded-md px-3',
        // ...
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: 'default',
      size: 'default',
    },
  }
);
```

### 3. Accessibility Implementation

**Decision**: Build accessibility into every component by default

**Rationale**:

- Ensures WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the start
- Reduces technical debt related to accessibility
- Improves user experience for all users
- Prevents accessibility issues from being overlooked

**Implementation**:

- Mandatory aria-label for IconButton components
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- High contrast support

### 4. Animation Strategy

**Decision**: Use Framer Motion for component animations with reduced motion support

**Rationale**:

- Provides declarative animation API
- Supports complex animation sequences
- Respects user accessibility preferences
- Offers good performance characteristics
- Integrates well with React patterns

**Implementation**:

```typescript
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

const AnimatedText = ({ children, delay = 0, ...props }) => (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay }}
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
  </motion.div>
)
```

### 5. Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Implement performance optimizations at the component level

**Rationale**:

- Provides better user experience out of the box
- Prevents performance issues from accumulating
- Enables efficient handling of large datasets
- Supports modern web performance standards

**Implementation**:

- Lazy loading with intersection observer (LazySection)
- Image optimization with responsive loading (OptimizedImage)
- Virtual scrolling for large lists (VirtualList)
- React.memo for expensive components
- Efficient re-render patterns

### 6. TypeScript Integration

**Decision**: Full TypeScript support with strict type checking

**Rationale**:

- Provides better developer experience
- Catches errors at compile time
- Enables better IDE support
- Improves code maintainability
- Supports component prop validation

**Implementation**:

```typescript
interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  variant?: 'default' | 'destructive' | 'outline' | 'secondary' | 'ghost' | 'link';
  size?: 'default' | 'sm' | 'lg' | 'icon';
  asChild?: boolean;
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Consistency**: All components follow the same architectural patterns
2. **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility reduces compliance issues
3. **Performance**: Components are optimized for performance by default
4. **Developer Experience**: TypeScript and consistent APIs improve productivity
5. **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes components easier to maintain
6. **Flexibility**: Compound components and variants provide usage flexibility

### Negative

1. **Bundle Size**: Some overhead from Framer Motion and utility libraries
2. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand CVA and compound component patterns
3. **Complexity**: More complex than simple styled components
4. **Dependencies**: Reliance on external libraries (Framer Motion, CVA)

### Neutral

1. **Testing Complexity**: Components require more comprehensive testing
2. **Documentation Overhead**: More detailed documentation needed
3. **Build Process**: Additional build-time processing for variants

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Styled Components

**Rejected because**:

- Runtime CSS-in-JS has performance implications
- Less aligned with utility-first approach
- Harder to maintain design system consistency

### 2. CSS Modules

**Rejected because**:

- More verbose than utility classes
- Harder to implement design system tokens
- Less flexible for responsive design

### 3. Emotion

**Rejected because**:

- Similar runtime performance concerns as styled-components
- Additional bundle size overhead
- More complex theming implementation

### 4. Plain CSS

**Rejected because**:

- Harder to maintain consistency
- More verbose responsive design
- No built-in variant management

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

```
src/
  components/
    ui/
      Button/
        Button.tsx
        Button.test.tsx
        Button.stories.tsx
        index.ts
      Card/
        Card.tsx
        CardHeader.tsx
        CardContent.tsx
        CardFooter.tsx
        Card.test.tsx
        Card.stories.tsx
        index.ts
      index.ts
```

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all component variants
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
- Visual regression testing with Storybook
- Interaction testing with Testing Library

### Documentation Approach

- Comprehensive Storybook stories
- TypeScript prop documentation
- Usage examples and best practices
- Accessibility guidelines

## Monitoring and Review

This ADR should be reviewed:

- When adding new component types
- If performance issues arise
- When accessibility standards change
- During major framework updates
