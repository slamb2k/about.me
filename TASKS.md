### 1a. Improve Test Coverage (New)
- [ ] Fix failing SSR and window mocking tests
- [ ] Improve responsive behavior test reliability
- [ ] Add tests for remaining components (HeroSection, ProjectsSection, ContactSection)
- [ ] Add accessibility testing with axe-core
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ actual test coverage

### 2. Create Reusable UI Components
- [ ] Extract Button component with variants
- [ ] Create Card component for projects/experience
- [ ] Build Section wrapper component
- [ ] Create AnimatedText component for consistent animations
- [ ] Build IconButton component
- [ ] Document components with Storybook

### 3. Implement Dynamic Route Generation
- [ ] Set up React Router
- [ ] Generate routes from navigation data
- [ ] Create individual pages for each section
- [ ] Implement smooth scroll with route updates
- [ ] Add URL-based section highlighting

## Medium Priority

### 4. Add Internationalization Support
- [ ] Set up i18n framework (react-i18next)
- [ ] Extract all text to translation files
- [ ] Support multiple languages in portfolio data
- [ ] Add language switcher component
- [ ] Implement RTL support

### 5. Create Environment-Specific Configuration
- [ ] Set up .env files for different environments
- [ ] Move API endpoints to environment config
- [ ] Configure build-time vs runtime settings
- [ ] Add environment-based feature flags
- [ ] Document configuration approach

## Additional Improvements

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for sections
- [ ] Add image optimization
- [ ] Use React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### 7. Accessibility Enhancements
- [ ] Add skip navigation links
- [ ] Improve keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add ARIA labels and descriptions
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### 8. Developer Experience
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks (Husky)
- [ ] Set up automated code formatting
- [ ] Add commit message validation
- [ ] Create component generator scripts
- [ ] Improve error boundaries

### 9. Documentation
- [ ] Document component API
- [ ] Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Document deployment process

### 10. CI/CD Improvements
- [ ] Add automated testing in CI
- [ ] Set up preview deployments
- [ ] Add bundle size monitoring
- [ ] Implement automated accessibility checks
- [ ] Add performance budgets

## Completed Items

### ✅ Unit Testing Foundation (Jan 2025)
- Vitest + React Testing Library setup
- Core component and hook testing
- Responsive behavior testing
- Coverage configuration (80% thresholds)
- Test documentation and README

## Notes

- **Testing**: Foundation complete, focus on improving test reliability and coverage
- **Component Reusability**: Next high priority item for immediate value
- Consider using a component library like Radix UI for accessible primitives
- Performance monitoring can use tools like Lighthouse CI
- For i18n, consider starting with just 2-3 languages to test the implementation

## Test Commands

```bash
npm run test          # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui       # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Run with coverage report
```
