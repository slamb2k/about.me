# TODO - Next Steps for component-forge

## High Priority

### 1. Add Unit Tests
- [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] Write tests for `useIsMobile` and `useHasSidebar` hooks
- [ ] Test PortfolioLandingPage component
- [ ] Test SidebarNavigation component
- [ ] Test responsive behavior and breakpoints
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ test coverage

### 2. Create Reusable UI Components
- [ ] Extract Button component with variants

- [ ] Build Section wrapper component
- [ ] Create AnimatedText component for consistent animations
- [ ] Build IconButton component
- [ ] Document components with Storybook

### 3. Implement Dynamic Route Generation
- [ ] Set up React Router
- [ ] Generate routes from navigation data
- [ ] Create individual pages for each section
- [ ] Implement smooth scroll with route updates
- [ ] Add URL-based section highlighting

## Medium Priority

### 4. Add Internationalization Support
- [ ] Set up i18n framework (react-i18next)
- [ ] Extract all text to translation files
- [ ] Support multiple languages in portfolio data
- [ ] Add language switcher component
- [ ] Implement RTL support

### 5. Create Environment-Specific Configuration

- [ ] Move API endpoints to environment config
- [ ] Configure build-time vs runtime settings
- [ ] Add environment-based feature flags
- [ ] Document configuration approach

## Additional Improvements

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for sections
- [ ] Add image optimization
- [ ] Use React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### 7. Accessibility Enhancements
- [ ] Add skip navigation links
- [ ] Improve keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add ARIA labels and descriptions
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### 8. Developer Experience
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks (Husky)
- [ ] Set up automated code formatting
- [ ] Add commit message validation
- [ ] Create component generator scripts
- [ ] Improve error boundaries

### 9. Documentation
- [ ] Document component API
- [ ] Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Document deployment process

### 10. CI/CD Improvements
- [ ] Add automated testing in CI
- [ ] Set up preview deployments
- [ ] Add bundle size monitoring
- [ ] Implement automated accessibility checks
- [ ] Add performance budgets

## Notes

- Priority should be given to testing and component reusability as they provide the most immediate value
- Consider using a component library like Radix UI for accessible primitives
- Performance monitoring can use tools like Lighthouse CI
- For i18n, consider starting with just 2-3 languages to test the implementation
